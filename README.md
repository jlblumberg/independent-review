# Developer Process Review

An independent, third party review of my developer process. Conducted by [CoGrammar](https://www.cogrammar.com/). 

### Summary

Similar to what one might experience in a tech test, this was an assessment of my process in solving a novel problem. The reviewer role-played a product owner with a set of non-technical requirements, and I used my developer process to convert these requirements into a working, tested, well-written application.

### Deliverables

In discussing the brief, I fleshed out the specifications, problem context, and potential edge cases. I then used an input-output diagram to plan my solution and prevent myself from over-engineering. You can see my raw notes from the planning stage [here](supporting_files/planning_notes.md).

After planning, I started test-driving the solution. You can see this in the commit history of this repository. 

After completing the assessment, the reviewer left me feedback on my developer process. You can see the feedback [here](supporting_files/2020-03-12-Blue-Clefable-59-feedback.pdf). You can also find a live recording of the session [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0F0e1YhXT4).
